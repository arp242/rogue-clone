The original rogue game, for modern systems.

There are many variants of rogue; this is the "original" as was shipped with BSD
systems since 4.2BSD from 1980; I used to play it on FreeBSD 4 back in the day,
but it was removed in FreeBSD 5. NetBSD and DragonFly BSD still ship it.

[The roguelike archive] has links for other variants, and [Wikipedia] has an
overview of the history.

This is the simplest rogue-like game that I know; there are no races, classes,
attributes, or many of the features you get in Angband, Dungeon Crawl, etc. This
is a feature! Sometimes you just want to play a simple game.
